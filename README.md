## Setup

### Install .NET Core

1. This program is written in C# and requires the .NET Core to run locally. For PC users click [this link](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/thank-you/sdk-2.2.203-windows-x64-installer) and follow the installation instructions. For Mac users click [this link](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/thank-you/sdk-2.2.106-macos-x64-installer) and follow the installation instructions.

2. Install dotnet script by entering the following command in your terminal: "dotnet tool install -g dotnet-script"

### Follow these instructions to clone & run the application locally using terminal commands. 

1. Enter the following command into your terminal program to clone the repo into a directory of your choice : 

          git clone https://github.com/joey3001/RoastOrToastChatBot.git


2. Run a bash terminal inside the directory /RoastOrToastBot in the newly cloned respository. 

3. In the terminal, type the command "dotnet run".

2. If your browser does not automatically open the page, open your preferred browser and enter "http://localhost:5000" in the navigation bar. If this does not work, look for the phrase "Now listening on:" written in your terminal a few lines after your "dotnet run" command. Navigate to the url written there.

3. At this point you are free to browse the existing data on the website. In order to modify the data, you must first register & login. Navigate to the "account" link in the navbar, and click the "Register" link. Enter an email & password; the email does not need to be functional and there are no requirements for the password. Now click the "Log in" link and enter the information you just registered with. You are now able to use all of the site's functionality!
